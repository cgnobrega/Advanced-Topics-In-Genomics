Introduction to R & tidyverse IN bioinformatics: 
- Experimental design -- see image:
	- RNA-seq data from the paper by Fu et al. 2015, GEO code GSE60450. This study examined expression in basal and luminal cells from mice at different stages (virgin, pregnant and lactating). There are 2 samples per group and 6 groups, 12 samples in total.

R in genomics - tools and miscellaneous info:
- [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/)
	- There is whole other universe out there other than CRAN for R packages, and it is called Bioconductor. These are exceptionally well curated R packages and libraries specific to the analysis of biological data. Unfortunately we do not have time to introduce you to Bioconductor, but this link will take you to the Bioconductor web site and from there it is easy to get lost exploring.
