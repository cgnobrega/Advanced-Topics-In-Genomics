- Can you clone the repo? Does it do what it intends?  Does it work?
- What don't you like? What would you do differently?

Another GitHub repo. This is our codebase for Lexos, a web app to provide a workflow for computational experiments on digitized texts (yup, it can work on, tokenize, DNA also). I provide this repo here just as an example of how a group, working on a very large coding project (20K lines of code) work together on "one" coding solution.

Jupyter Notebooks: 
- Download an example of a Jupyter Notebook, see file
- This .zipped folder contains a Jupyter Notebook used with Python code. The data is from a 1 Megawatt photovoltaic solar array. The first notebook (v1_data.ipynb) loads some climate data into Pandas dataframes. The second does some "machine learning" steps (e.g., cleaning the data, eliminating columns, setting up training vs. test data for a model, etc).
