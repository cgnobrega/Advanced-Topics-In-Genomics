# Introduction to NGS Methods

Read the following paper on NGS sequencing technology. 


Watch the first video discussing NGS sequencing methods. You might want to follow this up with the second, which gets a little more into library prep, up to you and how interested you are. The last two are definitely just FYI, and very method specific.
